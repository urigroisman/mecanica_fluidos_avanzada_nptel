Problem 8 â€“ Locus of a Fluid Particle

Given:
u = 0, v = y / (t + t0), w = 0
A particle is injected at (x0, y0, z0) at time t = t0.

We solve dx/dt = 0 -> x = x0, dz/dt = 0 -> z = z0
For y: dy/dt = y / (t + t0)
=> dy/y = dt / (t + t0)
=> ln y = ln(t + t0) + C => y = C1(t + t0)
Use y(t0) = y0 => y0 = C1(2t0) => C1 = y0 / 2t0
=> y = (y0 / 2t0)(t + t0)

Now eliminate t:
t = (y - y0)/(2t0) + t0

x = x0 => x/x0 = 1

Final equation:
x/x0 - (y - y0)/(2t0 v0) = 1

Correct answer: (a)
