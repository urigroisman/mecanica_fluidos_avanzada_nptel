## Problem 1

To determine if the vectors $\vec{a}$, $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ are coplanar, we evaluate the scalar triple product:

$$
\vec{a} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{c}) = 0
$$

This condition ensures that the volume of the parallelepiped they span is zero, meaning the vectors lie in the same plane.
