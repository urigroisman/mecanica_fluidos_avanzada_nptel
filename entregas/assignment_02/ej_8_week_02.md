# Week 02 ‚Äì Problem 8: Applicability of Bernoulli Equation in Entrance Region Flow

## üßÆ Problem Statement

For a steady and incompressible flow between two infinite parallel plates, points \( p \) and \( q \) are located close to each other along the centerline in the **core region near the entrance**.

Which of the following statements are true?

---

## üîç Option Analysis

### ‚úÖ (a) Bernoulli‚Äôs equation can be applied between the points \( p \) and \( q \) as the effect of viscosity is not felt in the flow in the core region.

This is **true**.

In the **entrance region**, the **core flow** near the centerline behaves **inviscidly**, because:

- Viscous diffusion has not yet reached the centerline
- Velocity gradients are small
- The flow is nearly plug-like

Hence, **Bernoulli‚Äôs equation is valid** in that region, even though the global flow is viscous.

---

### ‚ùå (b) Bernoulli‚Äôs equation is not applicable between the point \( p \) and \( q \).

This is **false**, for the same reasons stated above. Viscous effects are negligible in the core, so Bernoulli **is** applicable.

---

### ‚úÖ (c) Bernoulli‚Äôs equation is applicable between the points \( p \) and \( q \) as they lie along a streamline.

This is also **true**, assuming that:

- Points \( p \) and \( q \) are close together near the centerline
- They lie along the same streamline (which is plausible near the inlet of symmetric channel flow)

Since the flow is:

- Steady
- Incompressible
- Locally inviscid in the core

The Bernoulli equation **can be applied along a streamline** between \( p \) and \( q \).

---

### ‚úÖ (d) Both (a) and (c)

This is the correct choice.  
Both options (a) and (c) are individually valid and describe **different but compatible justifications** for using Bernoulli‚Äôs equation.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Answer

\[
\boxed{\text{(d) Both (a) and (c)}}
\]
